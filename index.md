I am an HQI Postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University, hosted by Prof. Jarad A. Mason in Chemistry. I also work closely with Prof. Julia Mundy in Physics. In Jan. 2022, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, advised by Prof. Gang Chen.

I am interested in understanding, manipulating, and optimizing the conversion, transfer, and storage of energy in phase-change and caloric materials, using tools including laser spectroscopy, synthetic chemistry, and ab initio calculations, to address challenges in energy and sustainability research.
