title: "Our work on imaging the phonon dynamics in nanostructures has been published on Nature!"
---

After almost two years of collaborative work, our work has finally been published on [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04736-8)! I am glad to contribute to this work as a theorist and clarify the microscopic physical picture in the vibrational EELS experiment. Also, see this nice [news piece](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01533-1) for a clear explanation.
