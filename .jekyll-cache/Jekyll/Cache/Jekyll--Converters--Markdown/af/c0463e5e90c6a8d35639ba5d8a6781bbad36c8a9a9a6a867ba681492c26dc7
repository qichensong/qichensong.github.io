I"¹<p>I am a HQI Postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University, hosted by Jarad Mason. In Jan. 2022, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT under Gang Chen.</p>

<p>I am interested in the fundamental study of charge and energy transport in heterostructures for efficient electronics and quantum computing.</p>

<p>I am also interested in understanding the thermal transport in noval inorganic materials for energy applications.</p>
