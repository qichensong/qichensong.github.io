I"¢<p>After almost two years of collaborative work, our work has finally been published on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04736-8">Nature</a>! I am glad to contribute to this work as a theorist and clarify the microscopic physical picture in the vibrational EELS experiment. Also, see this nice <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01533-1">news piece</a> for a clear explanation.</p>
