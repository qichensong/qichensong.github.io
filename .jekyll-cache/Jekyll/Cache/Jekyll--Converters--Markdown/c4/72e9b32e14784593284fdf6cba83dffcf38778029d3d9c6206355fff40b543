I"’<p>I am an Harvard Quantum Initiative Postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University, hosted by Prof. Jarad A. Mason in Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology. I also work closely with Prof. Julia A. Mundy in Department of Physics. In Jan. 2022, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, advised by Prof. Gang Chen.</p>

<p>I am interested in understanding, manipulating, and optimizing the conversion, transfer, and storage of energy in stimuli-responsive materials and energy systems, using tools including laser spectroscopy, synthetic chemistry, and ab initio calculations, to address challenges in energy and sustainability research.</p>
