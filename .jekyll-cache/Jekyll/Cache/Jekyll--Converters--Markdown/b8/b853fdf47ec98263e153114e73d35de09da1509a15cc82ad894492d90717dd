I"À<p>I am an HQI Postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University, hosted by Jarad Mason. In Jan. 2022, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, advised by Gang Chen.</p>

<p>I am interested in the fundamental study of charge and energy transport in heterostructures for efficient electronics and quantum computing.</p>

<p>I am also interested in understanding the thermal transport in novel inorganic materials for energy applications.</p>
